            <p><b>Movement to Music</b> is a creative system that generates music from videos with a single person movement perception.
                This showcase is under construction.

            <h3> Dataset </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Our dataset is composed with 18 youtube videos, with a fixed camera and a single person appearence through the whole video. Their configurations are 1080p and 30fps.

            <div class="my-5 px-3">
            	<h2> First Approach - Overall Motion </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                	Our first Implementation consists in preceiving speed, aceleration, fluidity, quantity of motion, contraction index and emotion from the overall movement. The instruments chosen to play the produced music are given by the colors we see on the background. This association comes with a personal synesthesia associating color to instrument. 
            	</p>
            	<p class="text-justify">
                	The music is produced in a major or minor scale given by the emotion transmited by the motion features. is the overall emotion is positive we produce in a major scale, otherwise we compose in a minor scale. The base scale note is chosen at random from the 12 notes. Given the scale we start with a random note from it and start composing from it. The duration of the notes on the first instrument are given by the speed at that time, aceleration will tell us if we should go up or down the scale in the next note and the fluidity will be the feature that will influenciate the variation from the previous note to the next. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                	The second instrument will play a music based on the same sacle but other random initial note from it. The variation from the initial note to the next is given by the quantity of motion, we derivate the quantity of motion feature to see if we should go higher or lower in the scale. At last, contraction index will give the duration of each note.

                <p class="text-justify">
                	This implementation has the same base of the first one. The instruments played are chosen likewise, and so is the scale.
            	</p>
            	<p class="text-justify">
            		In this implementation we focus only on the movement from above the waist and from the movement bellow and including the waist. This aproach only uses the speed, aceleration and fluidity of each set of body joints. There so, only uses the aproach of the first implementation for the first instrument, in each of our two sheets. The first instrument will play based on the movement from above the waist, and the second will play what it sees from the waist down.

                <p class="text-justify">
                	This approach is a mix of the first two. It will receive both aproaches, combined them and remove randomly half of the notes.
